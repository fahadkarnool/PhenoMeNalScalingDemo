This is to test Scalability of the PhenoMeNal Project using Jupyter and Luigi

The linear-regression file receives a csv dataset, runs linear regression and writes something to a .out file (same filename and location of the input dataset)

It is dockerised and the Dockerfile is attached

The linreg.py file can be used in Jupyter to create and run luigi tasks
