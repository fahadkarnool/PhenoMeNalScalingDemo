This is to test Scalability of the PhenoMeNal Project using Jupyter and Luigi

The linear-regression file receives a csv dataset, runs linear regression and writes something to a .out file (same filename and location of the input dataset)

It is dockerised and the Dockerfile is attached

More info about the container can be found at: https://hub.docker.com/r/nsadawi/lin-reg/



The linreg.py file can be used in Jupyter to create and run luigi tasks
