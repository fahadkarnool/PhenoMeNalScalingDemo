This is to test luigi on the KubeNow stack

The linear-regression file receives a csv dataset, runs linear regression and write something to a .out file (same file name and location of the input dataset)

It is dockerised and the Dockerfile is attached

the linreg file can be used in Jupyter to create and run luigi tasks
